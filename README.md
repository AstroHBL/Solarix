# Abstract

Solarix is a DeFi and GameFi token operating on the Fantom network. We've chose FTM because its fees are known for being extremely low compared to an average Ethereum or BSC transaction fee.
Solarix is a burnable and mintable, meaning its total circulating token supply can decrease. The mint function is usable only in certain necessary moments.

# GameFi

Solarix will be used to mint <i>Space Colonies</i> NFTs, which will earn you passive $SOLX income. NFTs can be however bought at Paintswap NFT Marketplace.

## Space Colonies

Space Colonies is an NFT blockchain game where users earn passive income of Solarix tokens by staking their <i>Space Colonies> NFTs, which can be bought by mint processor via NFT marketplace - however the NFTs bought at Paintswap will be more expensive with no risk, while minted NFTs will be way more cheaper but with a tiny risk of getting stolen, meaning the NFT goes to a random player that possesses an <i>Aggressive</i> type NFT, instead of the minter.
